/// Returns a pointer to the user's task object. May be nullptr. A nullptr indicates to Box2D that the work was executed
/// serially within the callback and there is no need to call FinishTaskCallback.<br/>
/// The itemCount is the number of Box2D work items that are to be partitioned among workers by the user's task system.<br/>
/// This is essentially a parallel-for. The minRange parameter is a suggestion of the minimum number of items to assign
/// per worker to reduce overhead. For example, suppose the task is small and that itemCount is 16. A minRange of 8 suggests
/// that your task system should split the work items among just two workers, even if you have more available.<br/>
/// In general the range [startIndex, endIndex) send to b2TaskCallback should obey:
/// <code>endIndex - startIndex &gt;= minRange</code><br/>
/// The exception of course is when itemCount &lt; minRange.
